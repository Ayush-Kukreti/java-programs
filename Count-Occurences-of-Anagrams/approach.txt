brute force
-- start with the brute force we will consider every substring and then compare it with the pattern and find if it is anagram or not.



better approach
-- if we apply sliding window then,
--idea is take a map which initiallt contains all the char of the pattern as the values (+ve for simplicity)
-- Once that map is ready 
-- start the sliding window template left=0, right=0
    -- at every right pointer add its count to the map (update the map by +1) the check if the current char count is 0 or not
        -- if the current char count is 0 then remove it from the map
    -- till the sliding window size is not hit we just simply increase the size of right pointer
    -- one SW size is hit we will check
        --map size is 0 or not 
            --if map size is 0 that means we found an anagram count++
        now we will also update/move left and right pointers by 1 value each
        -- before updating the left pointer we have to maintain the value in the map.
            -- decrement (the char value of the left pointer) in the map
            -- if the current char count is 0 then remove it from the map
        -- increment left++ right++
